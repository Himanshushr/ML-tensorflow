This repository contains implementations of various **machine learning algorithms** using **TensorFlow** and **Scikit-learn**. It serves as a learning resource for understanding the core concepts of ML through code.

## 📚 Algorithms Implemented

- 🔢 **Linear Regression** – Predict continuous values
- 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier** – Rule-based classification
- 💬 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Distance-based classification
- 🧠 **Logistic Regression** – Binary classification
- 🧩 **KMeans Clustering** – Unsupervised clustering
- 🎲 **Naive Bayes Classifier** – Probabilistic classification

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python and pip installed. Then install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run an Algorithm
Each algorithm is in its own .py file. Example:

bash
Copy
Edit
python linear_regression.py
